//! A Rust re-write of the basic building blocks of the [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/)
//! chess engine.
//!
//! This package is separated into two parts. Firstly, the board representation & associated functions
//! (the current crate, `pleco`), and secondly, the AI implementations using these chess foundations,
//! [pleco_engine](https://crates.io/crates/pleco_engine).
//!
//! This crate requires *nightly* Rust to use.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pleco) and can be
//! used by adding `pleco` to the dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! While generally a safe library, pleco was built with a focus of speed in mind. Usage of methods must be followed
//! carefully, as there are many possible ways to `panic` unexpectedly. Methods with the ability to panic will be
//! documented as such.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! You can create a [`Board`] with the starting position like so:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pleco::Board;
//! let board = Board::start_pos();
//! ```
//!
//! Generating a list of moves (Contained inside a [`MoveList`]) can be done with:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let list = board.generate_moves();
//! ```
//!
//! Applying and undoing moves is simple:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut board = Board::start_pos();
//! let list = board.generate_moves();
//!
//! for mov in list.iter() {
//!     board.apply_move(*mov);
//!     println!("{}",board.get_fen());
//!     board.undo_move();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Using fen strings is also supported:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let start_position = "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1";
//! let board = Board::from_fen(start_position).unwrap();
//! ```
//!

//! [`Board`]: board/struct.Board.html
